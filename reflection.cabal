description:
  This package provides an implementation of the ideas presented in the paper
  \"Functional Pearl: Implicit Configurations\" by Oleg Kiselyov and
  Chung-chieh Shan. However, the API has been streamlined to improve performance.
  .
  The original paper can be obtained from
  <http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~ccshan/prepose/prepose.pdf>.
  .
  /Changes from 0.5 to 1.1/:
  .
  * Much faster implementation available that is about 50 /times/ faster than
    0.9 and which runs purely on black magic. This version is now used by
    default. To turn it off install with the @slow@ flag. If you encounter a
    problem with the implementation, please contact the author.
  .
  * Removed @ReifiedNum@, @reflectNum@, and @reifyIntegral@; @reify@ and
    @reflect@ are about 3 orders of magnitude faster than the special case
    combinators were.
  .
  /Changes in 0.5/:
  .
  * Generalized the type signatures in reflect to allow you to pass any type
    with kind @* -> *@ wrapped around the desired type as the phantom type
    argument rather than just a @Proxy@.
  .
  /Changes in 0.4/:
  .
  * Converted from `Data.Tagged` to using `Data.Proxy` for reflection. This
    reduces the need for helper functions and scoped type variables in user
    code.
