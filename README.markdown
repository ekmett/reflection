reflection

[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/reflection.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/reflection) [![Build Status](https://github.com/ekmett/reflection/workflows/Haskell-CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ekmett/reflection/actions?query=workflow%3AHaskell-CI)

This package provides an implementation of the ideas presented in [Functional Pearl: Implicit Configurations](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/tr-15-04.pdf) by Oleg Kiselyov and Chung-Chieh Shan. However, the API has been implemented in a much more efficient manner.
